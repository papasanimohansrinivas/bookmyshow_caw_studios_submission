# simply run docker-compose build after cloning repo 
## it will build the docker images and then do docker-compose up -d

## after phpmyadmin is up, import cinemas_table_import.sql file using localhost:8080 gui on chrome

## then we can check the api from postman collection that is exported

## django migrations might take few minutes to take hold to up the docker compose so suggestion is to run the postman apis after few minutes
